# Workflow Analysis

## Development Process

### Project Initialization
1. **Environment Setup**: Python environment with required dependencies
2. **Directory Structure**: Create organized folder hierarchy
3. **Data Acquisition**: Import YouTube data exports from Google Takeout
4. **Initial Configuration**: Set up paths and basic parameters

### Analysis Pipeline Workflow

#### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- **Input Validation**: Check JSON file integrity and completeness
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove HTML entities, handle corrupted files
- **Standardization**: Parse timestamps, extract temporal features
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate viewing entries
- **Output**: `cleaned_watch_history.csv`

#### Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
The analysis runs in parallel streams, each focusing on different aspects:

**Temporal Analysis Stream**:
- Extract viewing patterns by time dimensions
- Generate peak usage statistics
- Create temporal visualizations
- Output temporal analysis results

**Content Analysis Stream**:
- Extract channel names from video titles
- Categorize content using keyword matching
- Generate word clouds and channel rankings
- Track content evolution over time

**Behavioral Analysis Stream**:
- Detect binge-watching sessions
- Calculate viewing frequency metrics
- Identify viewing habits and patterns
- Analyze session durations and gaps

**Personalized Insights Stream**:
- Align viewing with stated interests
- Track specific content categories (drag, podcasts, Norwegian pop)
- Generate personalized recommendations
- Create custom insight reports

#### Phase 3: Report Generation
- **Visualization Creation**: Generate high-resolution charts and graphs
- **Report Compilation**: Create comprehensive Markdown reports
- **Data Export**: Export results in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- **Integration Preparation**: Format reports for Obsidian integration

### Execution Patterns

#### Manual Execution
Individual scripts can be run independently:
```bash
python scripts/data_preparation.py
python scripts/temporal_analysis.py
python scripts/content_analysis.py
# ... etc
```

#### Automated Pipeline
Complete pipeline execution via automation script:
```bash
python scripts/run_analysis_pipeline.py
```

### Data Flow Management

#### Input Dependencies
- Raw YouTube JSON files must be placed in `data/UserData_YouTube/`
- Files should cover the intended analysis period (2020-2025)
- Corrupted files are handled gracefully with error reporting

#### Output Organization
- Results are categorized by analysis type
- Visualizations saved as high-resolution PNG files
- Reports generated in Markdown format for easy integration
- Data exports available in multiple formats

#### Quality Assurance
- Error handling for corrupted or missing data
- Progress reporting during long-running operations
- Validation of output file generation
- Consistent formatting across all outputs

### Update and Maintenance Workflow

#### Regular Updates
1. **New Data Integration**: Add new YouTube export data
2. **Pipeline Re-execution**: Run complete analysis with updated data
3. **Report Refresh**: Update all visualizations and reports
4. **Integration Sync**: Update Obsidian vault with new insights

#### Iterative Development
- Modular script design allows for independent updates
- New analysis modules can be added without affecting existing code
- Configuration changes can be made without code modifications
- Testing can be performed on individual components

### Branching Strategy (Future Development)
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for new features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes

### Collaboration Guidelines
- All code changes should include appropriate documentation
- New analysis modules should follow established patterns
- Testing should be performed before integration
- Updates to dependencies should be documented in requirements.txt
